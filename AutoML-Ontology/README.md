# AutoML-Ontology

The project for creating and use of ontology for AutoML. The improvement of the model search is performed by limiting search space by the most perspective algorithms. The suggestions of algorithms is made based on meta-features of previously proccesed datasets. The connection between meta-features and best algorithms are captured and stored in ontology for a later retrivial.

**Code** folder contains scripts for meta-features extraction, ontology creation and ontology usage.

**Tests** folder contains results of AutoML runs performed by different AutoML libraries using several constrains and enhanced by the created ontology.
