# AutoML-Ontology

The project for creating and using ontology for AutoML. The improvement of the model search is performed by limiting search space by the most perspective algorithms. The suggestion of algorithms is made based on meta-features of previously processed datasets. The connection between meta-features and best algorithms is captured and stored in ontology for later retrieval.

**Code** folder contains scripts for meta-features extraction, ontology creation and ontology usage.

**Data** folder contains data generated and used by the scripts, e.g., ontologies, meta-features, and classifiers.

**Tests** folder contains results of AutoML runs performed by different AutoML libraries using several constraints and enhanced by the created ontology.
